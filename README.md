| The project task was toto use Tableau visualizations to analyze operations, identify profit/loss drivers, evaluate advertising opportunities, and assess product return behavior. Findings will guide recommendations to improve profitability and avoid bankruptcy. |
| 3 | Storytelling with Data: Superstore Returns Project https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yolinda.rodrigues/viz/Sprint5Companyoverview/Dashboard1| This project is about analyzing customer returns at the Superstore. The CEO wants to understand why so many orders are being returned and how to reduce them. I used Tableau to explore the data, identify root causes, and present actionable insights through dashboards and a narrative story. |
