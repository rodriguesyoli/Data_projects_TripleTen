# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | PowerBi project| This project focuses on analyzing the Shopify App Store using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to the success of Shopify apps by building a structured Power BI report.|
| 2 | Superstore| The project task was toto use Tableau visualizations to analyze operations, identify profit/loss drivers, evaluate advertising opportunities, and assess product return behavior. Findings will guide recommendations to improve profitability and avoid bankruptcy. |
| 3 | Storytelling with Data: Superstore Returns Project| This project is about analyzing customer returns at the Superstore. The CEO wants to understand why so many orders are being returned and how to reduce them. I used Tableau to explore the data, identify root causes, and present actionable insights through dashboards and a narrative story. |
